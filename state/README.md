# Gean State Package

State management for the Gean Lean Ethereum client.

## Purpose

This package manages all state-related operations for Lean Consensus, including:
- Beacon state storage and retrieval
- State database operations
- State transition validation
- Historical state access
- State pruning and optimization

## Key Components

- **beacon**: Beacon state management
- **database**: State storage and retrieval
- **transitions**: State transition logic
- **pruning**: State pruning and optimization
- **cache**: State caching mechanisms

## Lean Consensus State

- Optimized for fast finality
- Support for validator set changes
- Efficient state storage
- Historical state access
- State synchronization support
